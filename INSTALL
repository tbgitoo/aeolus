AEOLUS 0.9.8  BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (ANDROID)
_______________________________________


This particular distribution of the Aeolus code is intended to be used as a source library in a Android Studio project. As such, it typically 
goes into a location like app/src/main/cpp/aeolus. Typically, you'll need to include it into your project hierarchy through a higher-level
CMakeLists.txt file, via appropriate an appropriate add_subdirectory(aeolus) directive (typicylly in the root CMakeLists.txt file, locate in the cpp folder), and you'll have to link the aeolus library directly or indirectly via appropriate target_link_libraries directives, as required in native C / Android projects in general. Behind the scenes, the "add_subdirectory" directive will invoke the CMakeList.txt file in this repository, leading to the production of a shared object library, which is linked as required to other libraries via the "target_link_libraries" directive.  

This library depends on clthreads, and Android version of which you can find at https://github.com/tbgitoo/clthreads. You need to hook up the clthreads library similarly to the present library with an add_subdirectory(clthreads) command in the root CMakeList.txt file. All in all, you should end up with a directory structure of the kind:

<Your Android Studio Project root>/app/src/main/cpp
						   /aeolus (and subdirectories)
                                                   /clthreads (and subdirectories)

Attention, clthreads contains a submodule (libbthread) which you will need to recursively initialize when cloning clthreads.
