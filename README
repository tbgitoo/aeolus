NOTE: This is a fork of https://github.com/SimulPiscator/aeolus, which is itself a fork of 
the original Aeolus available at https://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/aeolus/.


This fork is intended as a pure C++ library providing the basic synthesis capacities of Aeolus, without direct link to the output sound system, and
thus as a pure library for the digital signal generation capacity of the Aeolus system.
